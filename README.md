## Credits

Thanks to [Gustave Monce](https://github.com/gus33000) for his [SurfaceDuoPkg](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuoPkg), without it this repo would probally not exist. <br />
Also thanks to [Robotix22](https://github.com/Robotix22) for his [Mu-Qcom](https://github.com/Robotix22/Mu-Qcom) base. Without it, I would've had to re-port everything from my lost repo (not fun).
